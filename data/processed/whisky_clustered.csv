Probably the best feature is the perfect 50/50 blend of Islay peat smoke and charred oak barrel smoke. Though, I’m still not a fan of the heavy peatedness. And would prefer the oak char only. Nevertheless, on a lot of ice as it is served in bars and restaurants, this totally hits the spot. It’s completely reliable. For the price, this is impossible to beat.

Taste: Woody spices, quite thin in viscosity, watery even, mellow. Once swallowed, the next taste, is hard to distinguish, as the finish covers the flavours in the mouth, tastes like it's been watered down, as it's so thin and smooth, it’s the sort of whisky that you could drink alot of and get very drunk, quite quickly as it's so mild. Finish: Not a strong finish, not aggressive like some other Whisky's, it's milder and more refined, a good whisky for evening drinking, it already tastes like it's been diluted with water or ice. Hints of Pepper and a gentle lingering smokiness, perfect for the table, prehaps with cheese to clean your palette before the next course, would I buy again, yes to share amongst dinner guests who are unsure about Whisky's. Perfect with a strong cheese. || Fantastic whisky gentle flavours. Am not a whisky drinker but really love this one || Great for the price. Sometimes you just want a shot of something and not think about it too much. However, that doesn’t mean you should compromise on the flavour.

There are dried fruits, a touch of scented wood, fir trees, cedar, Moroccan leather, slightly foxed books, floor polish, and some ink.

Huge, highly complex and contemplative.","The mature depth seen on the nose comes immediately into focus, but before it goes towards the dark there’s a refreshing lift of aromatic and overripe fruits (quince especially) and a touch of spiciness.

The meaty element comes in quickly here, full-on grunt with animalic edges, cured leather and light bitter notes that bring to mid nutshell, espresso crema, damson jam, cacao nibs all balanced with some hedgerow berry fruits meaning that the back palate has a brighter lift than you might expect from something which is so dense and meaty (think of a berry sauce with venison).

I enjoy malt whisky in a whole range of styles, from smoky Islays to rich ""sherry bombs"" and all points between. But among the sweeter whiskies Aberlour has long been a firm favourite.

It is slightly shy initially, but with a sense of massed weight. Stewed black and orchard fruits (damson, black cherry) with an immediate earthy note and some spice. While there is some honeyed sweetness, this has greater maturity than the 12-year-old, coming across as leaf mulch, with a burnt element: dried Nora pepper/grilled red pepper and light blackened skin (the pepper’s that is, not human) and chocolate which moves the meatiness towards molé. The oak is more relaxed (or integrated) allowing the gutsy almost feral weight of the distillate greater say but there is some planed wood alongside light varnish, then nutmeg and raisin. It gets progressively darker and richer with some biltong/beef jerky hints balanced by the sweetness. It also gets slightly nuttier, reminiscent of mature Gouda/Emmental.","Big, quite deep, but also sweet. As on the nose, there’s some spiciness here (frying mustard seed). It is this sweeter element (toffee-like, with some dried apricot and the honey note seen on the nose) which comes over first. This softness then gives way to a chewy-mid palate where the darker fruits lurk. It then goes deep. Light, slightly leathery with malty elements then a gamey meatiness with supple tannins. However, rather than just the more powerful oak influence beginning to dominate the cooked fruits return adding a layered quality. Rather than sweetness you get a more savoury effect. Dark, full, liquorous, and rounded. As it moves into the back palate, so it starts to dry and pick up in terms of intensity and moves into the shadow of the trees.","Surprisingly, it sweetens again. Long, complex and, yes, meaty. Now you also get the Syrah-like sootiness.","I had purchased a couple of bottles of the 16-year-old Mortlach about12 years ago and I found it to be exceptional.

This drink does not meet those expectations at all. Raw, scratchy, metallic. The potential is there, but would have needed much more ageing. Overpositioning a product like this, and misleading customers by doing so will alienate fans from this otherwise quite palatable brand. Sorry. || Lovely,smooth tasty,warming. || 3.5. Pleasant dram. Nothing overpowering. You can tell there is some young liquid in here particularly on the nose which carries a little too much alcohol. As with many NAS drams, improves with resting and maybe a bit of ice (shock horror!). Hilarious reading these reviews though. My favourite comments are: - ""a good starting whisky"", subtly boasting that the reviewer is a seasoned veteran with a highly tuned palate, more used to complex flavours - ""there are better blends out there"", well yeah... there are some incredible blends out there. - ""tastes watered down"", well yeah!...its bottled at 40% which means the distillery almost certainly (as with any 40% bottling) added purified water when bottling... watering it down. While I'm at it - please stop slating people for adding water or ice to their dram. Its great. Also - stop harping on about the peatiness coming from the water, its nonesense. Thank you please || I drink it and I like it. But it’s too short on the finish and missing half of the palate. It is a bottle of all of the elements I love about Glenlivet, but too fast and not enough. With no pause in between. || A nice way to enter the single malts world and not just on the price.

Well worth the price and let the whisky snobs stay with their overpriced bottles. || This is such a pleasant change from the ""smack in the mouth"" peat you generally get from Islay. Because the peat used to dry the malt in Glen Moray is cut in the highlands, its constituent plants are very different from the coastal plants found on Islay. Resulting in a lovely peaty nose that is unmistakable, that is followed with a smoother and sweeter taste yet still quite spicy. For the current price, there are few peated malts to compare, and pretty much nothing from the Highlands that comes close. It's easily worth double, simply because Highland Peated Whisky is so rare. || Having bought this on a whim for £18 in a supermarket six months ago I've just got round to trying it.Bearing in mind I don't like Speyside as a rule this was out of character.Anyhow,credit where credit is due this is quite nice.Lovely peaty taste with a refreshing rhubarb undertone.I will quite happily polish this bottle off and buy another.3.75/5 || The character/personality is very good, but in the palate its youth is obvious.

The overall aroma is tightly integrated: spicy-sweet and fruity, combining spiky green leaves and dog roses with autumnal forests, toffee and rich vanilla sauce. The greenness comes to dominate, although the sour notes are tempered by sweet brown butter and a slice of candied fruit. Time reveals more herbal notes, with minty toffee and hints of pastry. Water opens all this up, drying and introducing Speyside notes of the sweetshop, with candy and dried apple rings joined by floral touches.","A balance of sweetness, acidity and tannic dryness. Nuts and spice lead, with hazelnuts and almonds joined by bitter walnuts and hot cinnamon. Sweetness builds behind, with candy, barley sugar and sharp candied lemons. The almonds reappear, now sugared, only to disappear amid more citrus, tempered by toffee and fudge spiced with cinnamon, and finally by fruity dark chocolate. Water cools; the smooth sweetness and spice rise, bringing a refreshing bitter note; cream, apple sauce and milk chocolate laced with oak, clove and dark chocolate.","Of medium-length, with buttery pastry, warming spice and a thin layer of sharp fruit; a fresh apple pie ready for the oven. The fruit lingers as apple skin, joined by crisp pear.","This is possibly the best value whisky I have encountered in decades; closest to a top Brora costing 20 to 30 times the price, touching on all the range that this vaunted and shuttered distillery musters. Of course this is a blend of multiple regions, but you suspect with micro contributions from many and large contributions from a few, particularly leading with a wonderful Clynelish (sibling distillery of the defunct Brora), and a masterfully light backing of an Islay, amongst others. This has a wonderful soaring range. I have both held and participated in single-malt whisky flights with many; this has had only rave responses, and from a wonderfully obscure and very cost-effective blend, that carries itself like an apex lightly-peated highland single-malt. I suspect the unorthodox story and lack of any historical reference lead to what I see as a deep discount, but also make this a wonderful “discovery”. When price and quality come together, I will buy for future years, and have happily loaded up on this one-off to the full extent my budget and conscience would let me. Just brilliant. || A lovely perfumed nose, and then spice, a bit of heat, some smoke, and lots of other things going on and great length.

That first encounter with one of the finest expressions of the Irish pot still whiskey tradition lives long in the memory. There's the loving, silken mouthfeel as you roll it around as if your tongue, teeth and gums have encountered the rays of the evening sun somehow miraculously transmuted into a warming, golden liquid. Then comes the flavour which starts at the front of the mouth with hints of cinder toffee, candied peel and parma violets which segues as that first mouthful is slowly swallowed into walnuts and Dutch tobacco. Then the aftermath which is redolent of a walk through an orange grove just as the fruits are landing in the basket.

For some reason I never thought much of this whiskey, I was more of a Bushmills drinker. I bought a bottle last year and I was very surprised. This whisky is quite mellow, not very light- but quite smooth, lots of toffee, vanilla, milk chocolate, buttery flavor. You can taste the presence of maize- that's right!- as one of ingredients. Very enjoyable on ice. This is a great buy in this price range, to me way better than Bushmills Original. || Smooth raisins at a great price. || I started off my whisky journey some years back with Glenmorangie, which I still regularly drink. This was my first time drinking Jameson, I only got it because it was on offer, and thought being Irish I'd try an Irish stable. Wow so underwhelming. Practically no finish, I had to double check I'd drunk some. Trying to figure out the nose, all I got seemed like ethanol, and the hit of my stomach the next day was reminiscent of knacker drinking Southern Comfort in my teenage years.
